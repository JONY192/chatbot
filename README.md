ChatBot Using TensorFlow and NLP


This repository contains a Python-based chatbot that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and TensorFlow to understand and respond to user inputs. The chatbot can interpret the context and intent behind human language, making it capable of providing intelligent and context-aware responses.

How the Chatbot Works
Intent Recognition:

The chatbot processes user inputs to determine their intent. It uses a JSON file (intents.json) that includes various predefined categories or intents, each associated with potential user inputs and corresponding responses.
Examples of intents include greetings, inquiries about the weather, or questions about services.
NLP and TensorFlow:

The core functionality of the chatbot is built using TensorFlow and a variety of NLP techniques.
The chatbot begins by tokenizing the user input, converting text into numerical data that the model can process.
A neural network is then trained on the dataset defined in intents.json, allowing the chatbot to classify user inputs into the appropriate intent categories.
Response Generation:

After identifying the user's intent, the chatbot selects a suitable response from the predefined options in the intents.json file.
This method ensures the chatbot provides relevant and contextually appropriate replies.
Interactive Notebook:

Included in the repository is a Jupyter Notebook (chatbot using NLP and TensorFlow.ipynb) that demonstrates the step-by-step process of building and training the chatbot.
This notebook is particularly useful for users who want to understand the underlying machine learning process or customize the chatbot for their needs.
Repository Structure
intents.json: This file contains the intents, sample user inputs, and possible responses. It serves as the core dataset for training the chatbot.
chatterbot.py: This Python script handles the logic for processing user inputs and generating responses based on the trained model.
